# 👋 Hi, I'm Vishal

I'm a software engineer in the making who enjoys **breaking problems apart and rebuilding them cleanly**.  
Most of my time goes into **Data Structures & Algorithms**, **system-level thinking**, and **learning how things actually work under the hood**.

---

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**
  - Dynamic Programming (strong focus)
  - Trees, Graphs, Binary Search
  - Monotonic Stack, Sliding Window, Greedy
  - Competitive Programming (Codeforces, CodeChef)

- **Core CS & Systems**
  - Memory models, performance, correctness
  - Understanding abstractions by peeling them back
  - Curious about Operating Systems and low-level design

- **Machine Learning (Learning Phase)**
  - Python-based ML stack
  - Interested in medical & analytical applications
  - Goal: build models that *observe*, not just predict

- **Web & Full Stack**
  - React, Spring Boot
  - Building interactive, animated, performance-conscious UIs
  - Security-aware deployments (auth, production hardening)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Languages**
- C++
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript

**Frameworks & Tools**
- React
- Spring Boot
- PyTorch
- Git & GitHub
- Linux

**CS Foundations**
- DSA
- OOP
- DBMS
- OS
- Computer Networks (learning)

---

## 📌 Current Goals

- Reach **top 10% on LeetCode**
- Become **exceptionally strong in Graphs & DP**
- Build a **serious ML-backed project** (medical or analytical)
- Deep dive into **Operating Systems internals**
- Write a **book-level explanation of Dynamic Programming** someday

---

## 🚀 Projects & Work

- 🔐 **Production-ready web apps** with proper authentication
- 🧠 **Algorithm-heavy problem solving repositories**
- 🌐 **Portfolio website** with custom animations & effects
- 🧪 Exploring **ML + medical data analysis**

(Projects are documented inside individual repositories.)

## 📊 Problem Solving Philosophy

> “If I can’t explain it clearly, I don’t understand it yet.”

I prefer:
- Clear invariants over clever hacks  
- Correctness before optimization  
- First principles over memorization

## 📫 Let’s Connect

- GitHub: **you’re already here**
- Learning, building, and iterating every day
